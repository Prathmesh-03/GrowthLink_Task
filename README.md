# GrowthLink_Task
This is a machine-learning project that helps users find out the type of flower 

Description:
In this project, I used the iris dataset. in this dataset, the length and width of sepal and petal are given and on that, there are three types of classification.
So first I have to import that dataset into a .ipynb file using pandas and check the basic stuff like null values, shape, data etc.
then I started to work on it like I had converted the target column i.e output column into int type using label encoder and after that, I applied different algorithms 
from that, I have selected one algorithm which gives the best performance i.e. multinomial naive Bayes.

Steps  :
1) directly use the dumped model using the pickle library and also read that .pkl file then give the input into (1,4) i.e 2D array and predict the output
